Video, Audio, and Image Steganographer with RC4 Encryption
Description
This project implements steganography for video, audio, and image files, coupled with RC4 encryption for enhanced data security. Steganography is the practice of hiding secret information within media files, while RC4 is a stream cipher used to encrypt and decrypt data.

This tool allows users to securely embed confidential data in multimedia files while ensuring it remains hidden and encrypted from unintended access.
